# In this file you can control which items to put in storage,
# to sell, or to leave in the inventory.
#
# Syntax:
# (item name) (minimum) (auto-store) (auto-sell) [put in cart] [get from cart]
# item name	: Name of the item.
# miminum	: The minimum amount of this item that you want to keep in inventory.
# autostore	: Set to 1 to walk back to a Kapra NPC to put in storage.
# autosell	: Set to 1 to sell item at a buy/sell NPC.
# put in cart	: Set to 1 to automatically put this item in cart.
# get from cart : Set to 1 to automatically get this item from cart.
#
# The example below will sell all jellopies, store all knifes and puts
# all flowers in cart:
#	Jellopy 0 0 1
#	Knife 0 1 0
#	Flower 0 0 0 1
#
# This example will get Red Potions from cart if you have less than 25
# of them in your inventory:
# 	Red Potion 25 0 0 0 0 1
#
# The item name isn't case sensitive. Only items found in this file will
# be stored or sold.
#
# If auto-store and auto-sell are 1, Kore will do storage first (unless
# storage is full) then sell.
#
# Kore will not sell or store equipped items. For example, if you're using
# a knife and you have a line to auto-sell all knives, kore will sell any
# extras it picks up, not the knife it's using.
#
# Don't forget to set the storageAuto, sellAuto and related configuration
# options in config.txt, or this file won't have any effect.
#
# An auto-sell list and auto-storage list is provided by default, modify it
# as you see fit.
